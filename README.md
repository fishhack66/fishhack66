- 👋 Hi, I’m @fishhack66
- 👀 I’m interested in 8-bit computing, in general; specifically 6800/6809 stuff
- 🌱 I recently relearned 6502 assembly and have gotten into 6800 assembly
- and hardware/projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much, 'cuz I don't know much.
- 📫 How to reach me ... well, ask. :^)
