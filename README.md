- 👋 Hi, I’m @fishhack66
- 👀 I’m interested in 8-bit computing, in general; specifically 6502 stuff
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ins and outs of Arduino/C++ coding; hardware-wise, low-level interfacing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on not much, 'cuz I don't know much.
- 📫 How to reach me ... well, ask in a comment for me to send to an e-mail.
